# assimilate-dot-files

## Simple bash script to pull dotfiles and set them up
## Script based on instructions and example from: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles

I claim no credit for the idea or implementation. This was simply the solution that made the most sense to me when I went looking for a way to manage and migrate dot files
across multiple systems/installations, etc.
